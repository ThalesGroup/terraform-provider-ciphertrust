```

### Edit the provider block in main.tf

```bash
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address  = "https://cm-address"
  username = "cm-username"
  password = "cm-password"
  domain   = "cm-domain"
}
```


### Edit the connection resource in main.tf

```bash
resource "ciphertrust_smb_connection" "SmbConnection" {
        name = "Unique_connection_name."
        description = "connection_description"
        password = "Password for SMB share."
        username = "Username for accessing SMB share."
}
```

## Run the Example
