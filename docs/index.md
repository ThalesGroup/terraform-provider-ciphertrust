  The CipherTrust provider can be used to configure a CipherTrust instance or cluster and subsequently manage resources.

# CipherTrust Provider

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

[Sample scripts](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/terraform-provider-ciphertrust/tree/main/sample-scripts) allow you to easily create CipherTrust Manager resources for your cloud and includes some practical examples of using the CipherTrust provider.

## Thales Devices
The following devices can be used to create keys for the above public clouds.
- CipherTrust Manager
- HSM Luna
- DSM

## Provider Initialization

All CipherTrust Provider parameters can be provided in :
 - The provider block of the terraform script
 - A configuration file ~/.ciphertrust/config

CipherTrust address and authentication parameters can be provided as environment variables also.

The following table illustrates which provider parameters can be provided as environment variables or in the configuration file.

| Provider Parameter   | Environment Variable | Config File             | Required | Default Value              |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|:------------------------|:---------|:---------------------------|
| address              | CM_ADDRESS           | address                 | Yes      | N/A                        |
| username             | CM_USERNAME          | username                | Yes      | N/A                        |
| password             | CM_PASSWORD          | password                | Yes      | N/A                        |
| domain               | CM_DOMAIN            | domain                  | No       | Empty string (root domain) |
| auth_domain          | CM_AUTH_DOMAIN       | auth_domain             | No       | Empty string (root domain) |
| replication_delay_ms | CM_REPLICATION_DELAY |replication_delay_ms     | No       |100 (milliseconds)          | 
| remaining parameters | no                   | yes                     | No       | N/A                        |
 
The order of precedence when determining the value of a provider parameter:
1. Provider Block
2. Environment Variable
3. Configuration File

## Provider Block

### For CipherTrust Manager

To authenticate to and log in to the root domain:
```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address      = "cm-address"
  username     = "cm-username"
  password     = "cm-password"
}

```
To authenticate to and log in to a domain other than root:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address      = "cm-address"
  username     = "cm-username"
  password     = "cm-password"
  auth_domain  = "users-auth-domain"
}
```

To authenticate to a domain but log in to a different domain:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address      = "cm-address"
  username     = "cm-username"
  password     = "cm-password"
  auth_domain  = "users-auth-domain"
  domain       = "a-different-domain"
}
```

### For CipherTrust Data Security Platform as a Service (CDSPaaS)

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address     = "cdsp-address"
  username    = "cdsp-tenant-username"
  password    = "cdsp-tenant-password"
  auth_domain = "cdsp-tenant-name"
}
```
## Configuration File

All provider parameters can be read from the configuration file.

The configuration file is ~/.ciphertrust/config. For example:

```terraform
  address = cm-address
  username = cm-username
  password = cm-password
```
If authentication values exist in the configuration file the provider block can be:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {}
 ```

### Environment variables

Some provider parameters can be specified in environment variables. For example:

```bash
export CM_USERNAME=cm-username
export CM_PASSWORD=cm-password
export CM_AUTH_DOMAIN=cm-auth-domain
export CM_DOMAIN=cm-domain
```

If environment variables required for authentication exist the provider block can be:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {}
 ```

## Schema

### Required

- **username** (String) Username of a CipherTrust user. username can be set in the provider block, via the CM_USERNAME environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config
- **password** (String, Sensitive) Password of a CipherTrust user. password can be set in the provider block, via the CM_PASSWORD environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config

### Optional

- `address` (String) HTTPS URL of the CipherTrust instance. An address need not be provided when creating a cluster of CipherTrust instances. address can be set in the provider block, via the CM_ADDRESS environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config
- `auth_domain` (String) CipherTrust authentication domain of the user. This is the domain where the user was created. auth_domain can be set in the provider block, via the CM_AUTH_DOMAIN environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is the empty string (root domain).
- `domain` (String) CipherTrust domain to log in to. domain can be set in the provider block, via the CM_DOMAIN environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is the empty string (root domain).
- `log_file` (String) Log file name. log_file can be set in the provider block or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is ctp.log.
- `log_level` (String) Logging level. log_level can be set in the provider block or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is info. Options: debug, info, warning or error.
- `no_ssl_verify` (Boolean) Set as false to verify the server's certificate chain and host name. no_ssl_verify can be set in the provider block or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is true.
- `replication_delay_ms` (Number) In the case of a CipherTrust Manager cluster behind a load balancer a small delay after creating CipherTrust Manager resources may be required to allow for replication to other cluster instances. replication_delay_ms can be set in the provider block, via the CM_REPLICATION_DELAY environment variable or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is 100.
- `rest_api_timeout` (Number) CipherTrust rest api timeout in seconds. rest_api_timeout can be set in the provider block or in ~/.ciphertrust/config. Default is 60.
