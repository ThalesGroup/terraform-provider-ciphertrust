# ciphertrust_azure_connection (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform Configuration for CipherTrust Provider

# This configuration demonstrates the creation of an azure connection resource
# with the CipherTrust provider, including setting up azure connection details,
# labels, and custom metadata.

terraform {
  # Define the required providers for the configuration
  required_providers {
    # CipherTrust provider for managing CipherTrust resources
    ciphertrust = {
      # The source of the provider
      source = "thalesgroup.com/oss/ciphertrust"
      # Version of the provider to use
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the CipherTrust provider for authentication
provider "ciphertrust" {
  # The address of the CipherTrust appliance (replace with the actual address)
  address = "https://52.87.160.91"

  # Username for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  username = "admin"

  # Password for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  password = "SamplePassword@1"

  bootstrap = "no"
}

# Define an azure connection resource with CipherTrust
resource "ciphertrust_azure_connection" "azure_connection" {
  # Name of the azure connection (unique identifier)
  name = "azure-connection"

  # Unique identifier for azure application
  client_id="3bf0dbe6-a2c7-431d-9a6f-4843b74c7e12"

  # Tenant ID for azure application
  tenant_id= "3bf0dbe6-a2c7-431d-9a6f-4843b74c71285nfjdu2"

  # Secret key for the azure application
  client_secret="3bf0dbe6-a2c7-431d-9a6f-4843b74c71285nfjdu2"

  # Name of the azure cloud
  cloud_name= "AzureCloud"

  # List of products associated with this azure connection
  # In this case, it's related to backup/restore operations
  products = [
    "cckm"
  ]

  # Description of the azure connection
  description = "a description of the connection"

  # Labels for categorizing the azure connection
  labels = {
    "environment" = "devenv"
  }

  # Custom metadata for the azure connection
  # This can be used to store additional information related to the azure connection
  meta = {
    "custom_meta_key1" = "custom_value1"  # Example custom metadata key-value pair
    "customer_meta_key2" = "custom_value2"  # Another custom metadata entry
  }
}

# Output the unique ID of the created azure connection
output "azure_connection_id" {
  # The value will be the ID of the azure connection resource
  value = ciphertrust_azure_connection.azure_connection.id
}

# Output the name of the created azure connection
output "azure_connection_name" {
  # The value will be the name of the azure connection resource
  value = ciphertrust_azure_connection.azure_connection.name
}
```

This option cannot be used with option is_certificate_used and client_secret.User first has to generate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in POST /v1/connectionmgmt/connections/csr. The generated CSR can be signed with any internal or external CA. The Certificate must have an RSA key strength of 2048 or 4096. User can also update the new external certificate in the existing connection. Any unused certificate will automatically deleted in 24 hours.The certificate should be provided in \n (newline) format.
