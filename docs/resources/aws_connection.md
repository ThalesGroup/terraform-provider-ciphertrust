# ciphertrust_aws_connection (Resource)

The APIs in this section deal with connections to the AWS cloud. The following operations can be performed:
* Create/Delete/Get/Update an AWS connection.
* List all AWS connections.
* Test an existing AWS connection.
*Test a connection that hasn't been created yet by passing in the connection parameters.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform Configuration for CipherTrust Provider

# This configuration demonstrates the creation of an AWS connection resource
# with the CipherTrust provider, including setting up AWS connection details,
# labels, and custom metadata.

terraform {
  # Define the required providers for the configuration
  required_providers {
    # CipherTrust provider for managing CipherTrust resources
    ciphertrust = {
      # The source of the provider
      source = "thalesgroup.com/oss/ciphertrust"
      # Version of the provider to use
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the CipherTrust provider for authentication
provider "ciphertrust" {
  # The address of the CipherTrust appliance (replace with the actual address)
  address = "https://10.10.10.10"

  # Username for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  username = "admin"

  # Password for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  password = "ChangeMe101!"

  bootstrap = "no"
}

# Define an AWS connection resource with CipherTrust
resource "ciphertrust_aws_connection" "aws_connection" {
  # Name of the AWS connection (unique identifier)
  name = "tf-aws-connection"

  # List of products associated with this AWS connection
  # In this case, it's related to backup/restore operations
  products = [
    "cckm"
  ]

  # Key ID of the AWS user.
  access_key_id = "ACCESS_KEY_ID"

  # Secret associated with the access key ID of the AWS user.
  secret_access_key = "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

  # Name of the cloud.
  cloud_name= "aws"

  # AWS region. only used when aws_sts_regional_endpoints is equal to regional otherwise, it takes default values according to Cloud Name given. For aws, default region will be "us-east-1".
  aws_region = "us-east-1"

  # Description about the connection.
  description = "Terraform Generated"

  # Labels for categorizing the AWS connection
  labels = {
      "environment" = "devenv"
  }

  # Custom metadata for the AWS connection
  # This can be used to store additional information related to the AWS connection
  meta = {
      "custom_meta_key1" = "custom_value1"
      "customer_meta_key2" = "custom_value2"
  }
}

# Output the unique ID of the created AWS connection
output "aws_connection_id" {
  # The value will be the ID of the AWS connection resource
  value = ciphertrust_aws_connection.aws_connection.id
}

# Output the name of the created AWS connection
output "aws_connection_name" {
  # The value will be the name of the AWS connection resource
  value = ciphertrust_aws_connection.aws_connection.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Unique connection name

### Optional

- `access_key_id` (String) Key ID of the AWS user
- `assume_role_arn` (String) AWS IAM role ARN
- `assume_role_external_id` (String) Specify AWS Role external ID
- `aws_region` (String) AWS region. only used when aws_sts_regional_endpoints is equal to regional otherwise, it takes default values according to Cloud Name given.Default values are: 
for aws, default region will be "us-east-1" 
for aws-us-gov, default region will be "us-gov-east-1" 
for aws-cn, default region will be "cn-north-1"
- `aws_sts_regional_endpoints` (String) By default, AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is available as a global service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com. Global requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) Region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token validity. valid values are: 
legacy (default): Uses the global AWS STS endpoint, sts.amazonaws.com 
regional: The SDK or tool always uses the AWS STS endpoint for the currently configured Region.
- `cloud_name` (String) Name of the cloud. Options are: 
aws (default) 
aws-us-gov 
aws-cn
- `description` (String) Description about the connection
- `iam_role_anywhere` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--iam_role_anywhere))
- `is_role_anywhere` (Boolean) Set the parameter to true to create connections of type AWS IAM Anywhere with temporary credentials.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are key/value pairs used to group resources. They are based on Kubernetes Labels, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/.
- `meta` (Map of String) Optional end-user or service data stored with the connection.
- `products` (List of String) Array of the CipherTrust products associated with the connection
- `secret_access_key` (String) Secret associated with the access key ID of the AWS user

### Read-Only

- `account` (String)
- `application` (String) The application this resource belongs to.
- `category` (String)
- `created_at` (String)
