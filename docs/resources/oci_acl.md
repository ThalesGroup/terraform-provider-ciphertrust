# ciphertrust_oci_acl (Resource)

Use this resource to create and manage OCI vault access control lists (ACLs) in CipherTrust Manager.

### Import an Existing OCI ACL

To import an existing ACL, first define a resource with
required values matching the existing ACLS's values then run the terraform import command specifying
the CipherTrust Manager vault ID and the user ID or group name separated by a semi-colon.

For example: `terraform import ciphertrust_oci_acl.imported_user_acl fd466e89-dc81-4d8d-bc3f-208b5f8e78a0:user:local|2f94d5b4-8563-464a-b32b-19aa50878073` or `terraform import ciphertrust_oci_acl.imported_group_acl fd466e89-dc81-4d8d-bc3f-208b5f8e78a0:group:CCKM Users`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Define an ACL for a CipherTrust Manager user
resource "ciphertrust_oci_acl" "user_acl" {
  vault_id = "ciphertrust-vault-id"
  user_id  = "ciphertrust-user-id"
  actions  = ["view", "keycreate", "keyupdate", "keydelete"]
}

# Define an ACL for a CipherTrust Manager group
resource "ciphertrust_oci_acl" "group_acl" {
  vault_id = "ciphertrust-vault-id"
  group    = "ciphertrust-group-name"
  actions  = ["keycreate", "keyupdate", "keydelete"]
}
```
